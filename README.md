# Challenge1

This challenge required reading through code to organize the the code so it is understandable for anyone reading it and add semantics so a screenreader can be used for whenever it is required.
In the HTML portion I added semantics to all headers, navigation, figures, and "alt" to the images. In the CSS I reorganized the position of some code so it flowed better, I also group related styles together. 

## Organization

The head tag contains the language, character set, CSS information and, title of the webpage.

The body is divided into five parts: 

### Header
Contains the organizations name and the navigation links for the website.

### Image
Group meeting image

### Section
The section contains three articles with headers and images

### Aside
The aside has three containers that provide additional information

### Footer
At the very end we have to footer tag that contains copyright information.
